## Technologies Used

In developing my Todo App, I utilized a range of modern web technologies to create an efficient and visually appealing application.

**React:**

I used React extensively, focusing on functional components for a modular codebase. Key features include:

- **Global State Management with useContext and TypeScript:** Managing global state with useContext and defining types with TypeScript.
- **State and Effect Hooks:** Utilizing useState for component state and useEffect for side effects.
- **Controlled Components:** Managing form inputs dynamically with useState and onChange.

**Asynchronous Operations:**

For asynchronous operations, I employed:

- **REST API Requests:** Integrating with a server for CRUD operations.
- **Promise, async/await, and Error Handling:** Using Promise, async/await, and try/catch for robust data fetching.

**Styling:**

To enhance the UI, I used:

- **Bulma.css:** For a clean and responsive design.
- **FontAwesome:** Adding intuitive icons for better UX.

**Animations:**

I implemented animations using:

- **React Transition Group:** Providing smooth transitions for TodoList items.
These technologies collectively ensure my Todo App is functional, efficient, and user-friendly.
